# Setup

Since we only have a few hours to get you up to speed on being a Javascript Developer, you would benefit from completing these steps before you arrive to the Workshop.

Don't worry if you run into any issues.  Our mentors will be ready to help you get set up upon your arrival.

* You'll need a modern browser: [Chrome](chrome.md)
* If you don't have a text editor where you can code we recommend [Sublime Text](brackets.md)
* We'll share some code during the Workshop. Having an account on [GitHub](github.md) will speed things up.
* You will develop Web server using Javascript.  Install [Node.js](nodejs.md) 
* If you can't install Node, you can still participate but will need [Cloud9](cloud9.md)

And once you are done, move on to learn about [HTML & CSS](../part1/README.md)
