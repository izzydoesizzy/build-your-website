# Introduction

Hello and thank you for joining us for the Build Your First Website workshop.

My name is [Izzy Piyale-Sheard](http://twitter.com/izzydoesizzy), the Community Manager at Lighthouse Labs and workshop leader today.

Over the last few years, I've led a group of 30-40 software developers around the world for a year, organized meetups with different startups in countries all over the world, and started working as the Community Manager at Lighthouse Labs.


## The goal

You may have previously attempted to teach yourself how to code, or how to build website in different ways. The goal of today isn't to teach oyu everything from scratch, but rather to give you a few tools to be able to quickly and easily hack together a website as quickly as possible.

We'll be working with an HTML template, then learning how to modify it and adapt it to our liking by using Chrome Devtools, then throwing it up live so others can see it.

## Pair programming

You're encouraged to buddy up with one other person. That said, both of you should ideally do the setup work individually on your own laptops.

## The product

The finished app that we'll be building in just a few hours today will look and feel much like this.

Let's get started with some [Setup](content/setup/README.md) or if you feel you can go faster here is a [Summary](SUMMARY.md) of all we'll cover.
